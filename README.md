# Ethernet MAMDWiz Library :computer: :satellite: :electric_plug:
## Summary
### What is Ethernet?
Ethernet (/ˈiːθərnɛt/) is a family of computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN) and wide area networks (WAN). It was commercially introduced in 1980 and first standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3. Ethernet has since retained a good deal of backward compatibility and has been refined to support higher bit rates, a greater number of nodes, and longer link distances. Over time, Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as Token Ring, FDDI and ARCNET. 

* Ethernet MAMDWiz Library is made for various Open Source Hardware Platform and support WIZnet's W5500 chip. 
* The Ethernet library lets you connect your Arduino to the Internet or a local network

## Requirements
- ``Arduino IDE 1.0.x and newer``
- WIZ550io module (using W5500 chip)

## Installation

This installs a package that can be used from Python:

```C
   #include <SPI.h>
   #include <EthernetMAMDWiz.h>
```

* Download all files and extract onto the "My Documents\Arduino\libraries\" folder in your project in sketch.

Or (recommended)

* To use a library in a sketch, select it from Sketch > Import Library (Zip file).
